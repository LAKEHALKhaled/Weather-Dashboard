# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

I used `OpenWeather One Call API` to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL.  I built a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. (jQuery and BOOTSTRAP)

I used `localStorage` to store persistent data.

## Who can use the app
```
A traveler can see the weather outlook for multiple cities so he can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Application step by step

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
Search for a city 
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
